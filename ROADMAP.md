## Our Vision: Speed & Animation

Ruixen UI is built on the principle that **great UI is fast UI**. Our focus areas are:

1. **Buttery-smooth animations** — Every interaction should feel responsive and delightful
2. **Performance-first design** — Components optimized for minimal bundle size and fast rendering
3. **Motion as a feature** — Thoughtful use of Framer Motion and CSS animations to enhance UX
4. **Accessibility without compromise** — Animations that respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
