## AI-native component installation

The Ruixen UI MCP server gives your AI-assisted IDE direct access to all 170+ components. Your editor understands the full registry — names, props, dependencies, install commands — so it can generate correct code on the first try.

No copying docs. No guessing component names. Just ask.

## Launching soon — completely free

We're building this as a free, open tool for every developer. No paid tiers, no gated features. The full component registry, every variant, every primitive — accessible to any MCP-compatible editor at zero cost.

The server is in final testing. Follow [@ruixen_ui](https://twitter.com/ruixen_ui) on Twitter to get notified the moment it ships.

## What it does

- **Component discovery** — Ask your IDE for any Ruixen UI component by name or description. It finds the right one.
- **Correct install commands** — The server returns the exact CLI command for your Tailwind version and primitive library.
- **Prop and usage context** — Your AI gets the full component API, not just a name. It writes working code.
- **All four registry variants** — Tailwind v4, Tailwind v3, Radix, and Base UI. The server knows which one you need.

## Supported editors

The MCP server will work with any editor that supports the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.com/):

- Cursor
- Windsurf
- Claude Code
- Cline
- Roo Code
