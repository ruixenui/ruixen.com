## Props

| Prop        | Type          | Default | Description                 |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------- | --------------------------- |
| `children`  | `string`      | -       | The text content (required) |
| `as`        | `TextElement` | `"p"`   | The HTML element to render  |
| `className` | `string`      | -       | Additional CSS classes      |

## Supported Elements

The `as` prop accepts: `p`, `span`, `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`.

## Features

- **Entry-Direction-Aware**: The resolve wave follows WHERE you enter — hover from the left and characters decode left-to-right, hover from the right and it sweeps right-to-left. Discovered, not configured.
- **Glyph Cycling**: During scramble, characters rapidly cycle through random glyphs at 30fps, creating the "cipher decode" visual
- **Three-Spring Lock-In**: Each character resolves with three coordinated springs — `y` snaps up from below (stiffness 500, damping 20), `scaleY` expands from compressed (600/24), and `opacity` fades in (400/28)
- **Spring Overshoot**: The `y` spring is underdamped (damping ratio ~0.45) — characters overshoot past baseline before settling, creating a satisfying "plop"
- **Staggered Wave**: Characters resolve ~42ms apart (1.4 frames × 30ms tick), creating a visible sweep across the text
- **Compressed Scramble State**: Unresolved characters are vertically compressed (scaleY 0.85), sunk (y +4px), and dimmed (opacity 0.35) — the resolve pop is the transition back to normal
- **No Cursor Tracking**: Unlike proximity-based text effects, this is trigger-based — the animation plays once per hover, no continuous tracking
