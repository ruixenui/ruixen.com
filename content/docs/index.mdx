Ruixen UI is a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your web apps.

It focuses on **speed, easy rendering, reusability, and tunability**, making it simple to create polished landing pages, product sites, and marketing materials with minimal effort.

## Our Approach

**We believe software should not only work fast but also look great while doing so.**  
Design plays a critical role in establishing trust between you and your users. With Ruixen UI, you don’t just ship features — you ship confidence.

Our guiding principles:

- **Speed first** – Components are optimized for quick rendering and smooth interactions.
- **Reusability** – Write once, use anywhere. Copy, paste, and customize with ease.
- **Tunability** – Flexible props and configuration so you can adapt components to your brand.
- **Developer-friendly** – Clear structure and clean code you can extend without friction.

Good design is more than aesthetics — it reflects stability and care.  
If a product pays attention to small details in design, you can trust that it values its users just as much.

A great example is [linear.app](https://linear.app), whose landing page alone built immediate trust in their product.

Ruixen UI carries the same spirit — but with the **goal of helping developers move faster** while still delivering a refined experience.

This library is heavily inspired by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com), but with our own twist on **performance, adaptability, and reusability**.
