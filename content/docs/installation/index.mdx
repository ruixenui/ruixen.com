**Note:** We follow the same installation process as [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/).

<Steps>

### Create project

Run the `init` command to create a new Next.js project or to setup an existing one:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

### Add components

You can now start adding components to your project.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add "https://ruixen.com/r/invert-tabs"
```

### Import and use

The command copies the component source into your project. Import it directly:

```tsx
import { InvertTabs } from "@/components/ruixen/invert-tabs";

export default function Demo() {
  return <InvertTabs />;
}
```

</Steps>
