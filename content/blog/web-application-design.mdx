Modern web apps succeed when **tasks are obvious**, **state is predictable**, and **latency feels low**. This guide assembles proven patterns for **navigation, tables, forms, realtime UX, error handling,** and **Next.js** architecture.

## 1) Navigation That Scales

- Primary nav for **core objects** (e.g., Projects, Reports).  
- Secondary nav for **contextual tasks** (e.g., Settings per project).  
- Keep global search omnipresent (Cmd/Ctrl + K).  
- For multi-tenant apps, make tenant switch **fast and obvious**.

**Command palette (skeleton)**

```tsx
// app/components/command-palette.tsx
export function CommandPalette() { /* implement with kbar or your own */ return null; }
```

---

## 2) Data Tables (real-world patterns)

- Progressive disclosure: concise default view, expandable rows for detail.  
- **Column presets** by role (Owner, Analyst, Support).  
- Sticky header + first column improves orientation.  
- Inline edit only for **atomic fields**; use modals/drawers for complex edits.  
- Bulk actions: show them **after** selection.

**Empty, loading, error**

- Empty: teach with examples and a primary CTA.  
- Loading: skeletons with consistent dimensions.  
- Error: retry inline; log a correlation ID.

---

## 3) Forms Users Can Trust

- Group fields into **logical sections**; keep forms short.  
- Use **inline validation** on blur; avoid full-page scroll to errors.  
- Autosave drafts on long forms.  
- Review step for **destructive** or **irreversible** actions.

**Optimistic updates**

- Update UI first; reconcile with server response.  
- On failure, revert and show a clear reason + retry.

---

## 4) Realtime UX Without the Noise

- Reflect server events in UI unobtrusively (toasts, subtle badges).  
- Timestamps: display **relative** (e.g., “2m ago”), reveal absolute on hover.  
- Rate-limit toast spam; coalesce repeated messages.

---

## 5) Error States, Empty States, Limits

- Create a **gallery** of system messages and their remedies.  
- Use different tones for **validation vs. system** errors.  
- Don’t make users retype long inputs; keep context.

---

## 6) Next.js Architecture (App Router)

**Data fetching**

- Default to **Server Components** for data-heavy screens.  
- Cache where possible; revalidate precisely.

```tsx
// app/projects/page.tsx
export const revalidate = 30;

async function getProjects() {
  const res = await fetch(process.env.API_URL + "/projects", { next: { revalidate: 30 } });
  return res.json();
}

export default async function Page() {
  const projects = await getProjects();
  return <ProjectsTable data={projects} />;
}
```

**Mutations**

- Prefer **Server Actions** or **route handlers** for mutations; handle optimistic UI on the client.

```tsx
// app/actions/create-project.ts
"use server";
export async function createProject(formData: FormData) { /* ... */ }
```

**Loading & error boundaries**

- Implement `loading.tsx` and `error.tsx` per route; keep them lightweight.

---

## 7) State Management (pragmatic)

- Co-locate state with components; lift only when needed.  
- Use URL for shareable state (filters, sorting).  
- Reach for global stores **sparingly**; server as source of truth.

---

## 8) Authorization & Auditing

- Design for **RBAC** first; map permissions to UI affordances.  
- Disable and explain inaccessible actions; don’t hide everything.  
- Keep an **audit trail** for key objects; show who changed what, when.

---

## 9) Performance & Perceived Speed

- Stream large lists: virtualize on the client when necessary.  
- Preload likely routes on hover/viewport.  
- Keep interactions **under 100ms** when possible; show progress otherwise.  
- Measure with field data; don’t rely on lab-only results.

---

## 10) Dark Mode & Themes

- Provide an explicit theme switch; persist per user.  
- Avoid pure black/white; use soft neutrals for comfort.  
- Ensure charts and data viz work in both themes.

---

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Core tasks visible within 1–2 clicks  
- [ ] Clear empty/loading/error patterns  
- [ ] Keyboard + screen reader flows verified  
- [ ] Server actions covered with optimistic UI + rollback  
- [ ] Measured, not guessed: UX metrics tracked
