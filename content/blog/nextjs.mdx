## What Is NextJS?

![NextJS](https://ruixen.com/assets/lh7h7pc2pai.jpg)

NextJS is an open-source web development framework that empowers React-based web applications with server-side rendering and static website generation. React documentation recommends NextJS among the recommended toolchains, suggesting it to developers when building a server-rendered website with Node.js.

Unlike traditional React apps that can solely render their content in the client-side browser, NextJS extends this functionality to applications rendered on the server side. This dynamic framework is copyrighted and trademarked by Vercel, the private company that created it, and continues to lead its open-source development.

### Powerful Framework for Building SEO-Friendly Apps

NextJS is renowned for its robust capabilities, including server-side rendering (SSR) and enhanced search engine optimization (SEO). NextJS offers built-in routing, simplifying the creation of dynamic routes and navigation handling within your application. With the increased emphasis on performance and SEO in modern web development, leveraging a framework like NextJS can offer a significant advantage in building high-performing, SEO-friendly web applications.

### Streamlined Development and Enhanced Performance

You have access to its versatile features that streamline the development process and enhance the performance of web applications. Its server-side rendering capabilities can lead to faster loading times and improved SEO, resulting in better search engine rankings and increased visibility. The built-in routing functionality simplifies your application's navigation structure, making it easier for users to navigate through pages seamlessly.

### The Go-To Choice for High-Performance

[NextJS](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) provides a robust foundation for developing high-performance web applications with enhanced SEO, faster load times, and improved user experience. With its server-side rendering capabilities and built-in routing, NextJS is a go-to choice for developers looking to create dynamic and search engine-friendly web applications.

## NextJS Styling And Features

NextJS supports styling with:

- CSS
- Precompiled Scss and Sass
- CSS-in-JS
- Styled JSX
- TypeScript support
- Smart bundling
- Open-source transpilers such as SWC

[TurboPack bundles](https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/turbopack) modules after transformation; all these tools are used with npm in a terminal.

### Server-Side Rendering for Performance and Security

The main [highlight of NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/nextjs-compiler) is its server-side rendering feature that lessens the burden on web browsers and enhances security. Server-side rendering can be implemented for any part of the application or the entire system, allowing content-rich pages to be singled out for server-side rendering.

It can be applied only for first-time visitors to lessen the load on web browsers that have not downloaded any site assets yet. The hot reloading feature detects code changes and re-renders appropriate pages, avoiding the need to restart the server.

### Development with Routing, Hot Reloading, and More

NextJS utilizes page-based routing for developer convenience and supports dynamic routing. Other notable features include hot-module replacement for live module replacement, automatic code splitting that includes only necessary code for page loading, and page prefetching to reduce load time.

It also supports incremental static regeneration and static site generation. During build time, a pre-built version of the website is usually saved as a .next folder consisting of static HTML pages cached and sent to users when requested.

NextJS provides numerous features such as:

- Server-side rendering
- Hot reloading
- Automatic code splitting
- Page prefetching
